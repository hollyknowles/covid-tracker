# CovidTracker

This is a discord bot which informs users of the latest Covid data around the world

- Covid data is from the worldometer API from rapidapi.com https://rapidapi.com/Shouvik/api/worldometer-covid-19
- Discord developer portal for all things discord https://discord.com/developers/applications

todo: refactor so the data is only called from API 5x per day, and save that data in a json, then when user goes !new, its read from the json and not calling the api everytime
